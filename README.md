# adventure-game
Just a fun java text adventure game that's horribly coded, but used to practice basic problem solving issues. Project board located under Projects tab.

## For Pull Requests:

I am planning on having pull requests for this project instead of pushing to the main branch every time. If you need any help or have any questions on the process,  
reach out to me and I can help you out! 

## How to create a new branch:

In git bash when you are planning on adding a new feature or fixing bugs, before you get started you will use:  
**git checkout -b your-branch-name-here**  
  
This will create a new branch off of the main branch (always make sure you are on master or main before creating the branch). When you are done adding the new feature  
or fixing a bug, you will create a pull request.

## How to create a pull request:

In github, you will go to the project. There should be a button that pops up automatically for creating a pull request. When you create the pull request, in the  
comments add a brief description as to what your branch is doing for the code (such as what feature you are adding in).  When the pull request is made, we can all  
see what changes are being made and review them. This way we can all look and see if there are easier or more optimized ways to do things.  

### Have fun!

I just wanted to make a simple project to work on with a few friends and any ideas for collaborating on I am definitely open to. :) I **LOVE** you guys!!!
