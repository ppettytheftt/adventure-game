# adventure-game
Just a fun java text adventure game that's horribly coded, but used to practice basic problem solving issues. Project board located under Projects tab.

## For Pull Requests:

I am planning on having pull requests for this project instead of pushing to the main branch every time. If you need any help or have any questions on the process, reach out to me and I can help you out! 

## How to create a new branch:

In git bash when you are planning on adding a new feature or fixing bugs, before you get started you will use:  
**git checkout -b your-branch-name-here**  
  
This will create a new branch off of the main branch (always make sure you are on master or main before creating the branch). When you are done adding the new feature or fixing a bug, you will create a pull request.

## How to create a pull request:

In github, you will go to the project. There should be a button that pops up automatically for creating a pull request. When you create the pull request, in the comments add a brief description as to what your branch is doing for the code (such as what feature you are adding in).  When the pull request is made, we can all see what changes are being made and review them. This way we can all look and see if there are easier or more optimized ways to do things.  

## Project Board

The project board located under the projects tab has kanban style board with what needs to be done. We can do our planning and everything on that board. This board has all of the issues listed (under the issues tab) that need to be taken care of. Pull requests can be tagged on these issues so that they will automatically move through the board as they are completed (some columns are automated). For any questions about the system you can add a new Issue and add a question tag to that issue. I can go on and answer any questions about how the program works or we can use this to ask for help with how to complete an issue. If you have any questions about the project board or how to use it, don't be afraid to reach out to me.  
Collaboration is the name of the game!

### Have fun!

I just wanted to make a simple project to work on with a few friends and any ideas for collaborating on I am definitely open to. :) I **LOVE** you guys!!!
